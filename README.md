iTransmission 4
==========
iTransmission, basically, is a torrent client, which uses libtransmission as it's backend.

So, what is iTransmission 4? iTransmission , originally, was developed by [ccp0101](https://github.com/ccp0101). It is no longer kept active. I plan on keeping iTransmision 4 active, as well as building it for older devices (currently as old as iOS 4/iPT 2).

This is an extension to [ioshomebrew's](https://github.com/ioshomebrew) iTransmission 3, which is basically a torrent client for iOS, which I plan on keeping active and adding new features to as per my requirements and requests from you i.e. the user.
I've already added lots of stuff.

Compiling libraries
-----
~~You may wish to compile iTransmission libraries yourself~~

There is no longer a need to compile iTransmission libraries yourself. I've already done that for you. The libraries include armv6, armv7, armv7s and arm64. They are in iTransmission/libraries folder, in zip format. Unzip them and you can run, build, etc. the project from XCode freely.

Yet, if you still want to be adventurous, I have added the required files in a folder named 'compilation'.

How to compile libraries
_____
Open terminal
cd to Compilation directory
./build.sh
If you need to change options, edit the configuration & build.sh file in Compilation directory. 

Compiling app
-----
Compiling may be a bit hard, and depends upon your target. I will cover the basics below. I assume that you are using Mac OS X and have XCode.
You can't compile the app without either of those. But, I've included a pre-compiled app. Use that with Installation Option I or II.

1. The app will never be accepted in the app store. Therefore, we do not need codesigning. But XCode requires us to codesign each and every app. Assuming I use the iOS 5.1 SDK, I can disable this check by opening /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS5.1.sdk/SDKSettings.plist with a text editor (not XCode) and change the following values 

```
<key>CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED</key>
<string>YES</string>
```
to 
```
<key>CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED</key>
<string>NO</string>
```


```
<key>ENTITLEMENTS_REQUIRED</key>
<string>YES</string>
```
to 
```
<key>ENTITLEMENTS_REQUIRED</key>
<string>NO</string>
```

2. This project uses IOKit framework , which is a private framework. But, I found it's headers. Decompress IOKit Headers.zip(present in "Project" directory), and copy the resulting Headers folder to /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS5.1.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/IOKit.framework

3. I've added a build rule to compile the project using GCC 4.8, which I require for compiling this app for armv6. If you want to compile it for armv7s or arm64, remove it.

4. You may also want to change the minimum deployment target to your choice and the base SDK to your choice also

Installation
-----
Installation is the easiest part.
You will need a jailbroken iDevice.

**OPTION I**

1. Put the compiled .app in the /Applications folder of your iDevice.
2. SSH into your device and execute the following command(without double-quotes):"cd /Applica*/iTransm*;chmod 777 ./iTransmission; cd ~/;"

**OPTION II**

1. Make a folder. Name doesn't matter, but using "iTransmission" here.
2. Open the folder.
3. Make a folder named "Payload". Name matters here.
4. Copy the compiled .app into the Payload folder.
5. Compress(Zip only) the iTransmission folder to iTransmission.zip
6. Rename iTransmission.zip to iTransmission.ipa
