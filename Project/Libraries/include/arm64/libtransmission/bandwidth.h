/**
 * Bandwidth is an object for measuring and constraining bandwidth speeds.
 *
 * Bandwidth objects can be "stacked" so that a peer can be made to obey
 * multiple constraints (for example, obeying the global speed limit and a
 * per-torrent speed limit).
 *
 * HIERARCHY
 *
 *   Transmission's bandwidth hierarchy is a tree.
 *   At the top is the global bandwidth object owned by tr_session.
 *   Its children are per-torrent bandwidth objects owned by tr_torrent.
 *   Underneath those are per-peer bandwidth objects owned by tr_peer.
 *
 *   tr_session also owns a tr_handshake's bandwidths, so that the handshake
 *   I/O can be counted in the global raw totals. When the handshake is done,
 *   the bandwidth's ownership passes to a tr_peer.
 *
 * MEASURING
 *
 *   When you ask a bandwidth object for its speed, it gives the speed of the
 *   subtree underneath it as well. So you can get Transmission's overall
 *   speed by quering tr_session's bandwidth, per-torrent speeds by asking
 *   tr_torrent's bandwidth, and per-peer speeds by asking tr_peer's bandwidth.
 *
 * CONSTRAINING
 *
 *   Call tr_bandwidthAllocate () periodically. tr_bandwidth knows its current
 *   speed and will decide how many bytes to make available over the
 *   user-specified period to reach the user-specified desired speed.
 *   If appropriate, it notifies its peer-ios that new bandwidth is available.
 *
 *   tr_bandwidthAllocate () operates on the tr_bandwidth subtree, so usually
 *   you'll only need to invoke it for the top-level tr_session bandwidth.
 *
 *   The peer-ios all have a pointer to their associated tr_bandwidth object,
 *   and call tr_bandwidthClamp () before performing I/O to see how much
 *   bandwidth they can safely use.
